   <h3>Mothers in the Competitive World of New York</h3>

   <p>              I remember my father one day while driving us to school on the FDR looking over the East River as we were about to leave the highway. I was 8, and my brother was 6. Every day that we went to school, my father and I would talk about something different, and today happened to be about my mother. He mentioned how my mother had managed to secure a big job renovating a floor in Trump Tower, and my brother and I both turned our heads from the window to ask how? When? Why? This was 2016, just after Trump was elected. My father said that she was very famous for doing high-end apartments and said that she had even been part of the first group of all-women to ring the bell on the New York Stock Exchange. He didn't say much more about it after that because we had reached my school. I walked into the ugly green DOE-tiled cafeteria full of curiosity for what had happened. Later that day when we were working on computers, when the teacher was not looking, I looked up the article and read it, and there my mother was on the stage ringing the bell with a group of about 15 other women. It was really surprising to see this, as I knew my mother was a successful businesswoman, but this put it into perspective of just how successful she is. However, later my father told me the story of the day this happened. My mother had no idea this was going to happen, and she had forgotten about it. My father had come home early that day from work and saw he r sitting and working, and it was 11:30, and the event was at 12, so my father rushed her out of the door, leaving my mother frazzled as she caught a cab to the event and just walked up on some stage that she was escorted to. She just smiled and waved as she realized she was in the front row and going to ring in the NYSE bellâ€”an absolute icon.

<p>    People in New York are ambitious as hell, especially women in competitive industries such as architecture, fashion, and other very specific but needed companies. My mother, like many other young women who come to New York, was definitely meant to be here and in that sort of intense competition and rat race to work hard and win big in a kind of twisted American dream. My mother, in fact, came into the world of architecture in a very strange way. Her to-be business partner was working for a big burly Greek guy who ran a construction company, and my mother had joined the company as a project manager. She saw how ineffective and sloppy the job all the guys were doing just sitting around making careless mistakes, so she decided to quit and convinced another girl to join her in creating a new company that was going to dominate over this one easily. They did and named it Ariel Design and Build. The Greek guy was really pissed about that, but happenstance would have it that they bid on the same project some years later and got the project instead of that guy, and eventually, that guy went bankrupt.
</p>
<p>        As my mother got older, she expanded the business far and wide, becoming a reputable name among the upper echelon of New York society. While she was raising me and my brother as toddlers, she broke $5 million in revenue in the company, which she was the first in her family to do. She did it while also balancing raising a family. I always had a love-hate relationship with my mother's work because to young me, it looked as though she was working all the time. Whenever I would come home, she would always be on the couch taking a phone call, or if we were watching a movie, she would fall asleep on the couch because she woke up early to work that morning.
</p>

<p>          However, as I got older, I understood that this apparent "workaholic" behavior I had seen was normal for people in NYC. Not just normal, but it was how they stayed alive in this incredibly fast-paced cutthroat environment and what allowed my mother to be so successful and what I see that allows so many families to be so successful. What is so interesting is then how this behavior gets passed on through generations. I see myself and my brother existing in this rigid competitive environment and having the skills to deal with it from our mother in tests like SHSAT where my brother sat and studied for months to get a good grade on it. Or the ability to research and try to solve issues with strong self-reliance that we consistently hear about from our mother from our relatives. And, to be cutthroat. When my mother returned to India for the first time after 2 years in America, she came during Diwali when Indians like to gamble, and on that night, my mother walked away with the largest pot any of the other players had ever seen. Everyone was thinking this is that New York inside of her, and my brother and I always walk away with the largest pot during Diwali.
